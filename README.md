# Energy_Save_with_Online_Conference

> We explored the impact of online conferences on the environment, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this project, we estimated the energy saving by simulating two international conferences.
> we conducted web scraping on two international conference websites American Mathematical Society(AMS) and Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS) to collect information on attendees and their mode of transportation.
> This research project was supervised by Prof. Lisa Jeffrey, Department of Mathematics, University of Toronto.
